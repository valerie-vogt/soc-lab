# Build — Windows 11 Lab VM
Date: 2026-08-12

## What I was trying to do
Build a windows vm for simulated logs and telemetry.
## What I built / ran
Windows 11 enterprise vm: 2 cores 4gb ram
## What it does now
Awaiting configuration
## Where I got stuck and how I got unstuck
Instillation went smooth, went though the instillation gui, loaded virtio drivers and got to a desktop. i was greeted with no internet, i firstly checked device manager and saw there was a problem with the ethernet controller, i then updated the drivers from the virtio drive image and gained connectivity.
## What this would look like in a real environment
in a SOC context, this machine generates the event logs, process creation records, and network connections that a Tier 1 analyst investigates. Without an endpoint like this, there's nothing to monitor.
